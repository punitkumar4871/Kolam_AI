Types of Kolam: 
Complete Classification and Detailed Properties
Kolam is a traditional South Indian floor art form that encompasses diverse patterns and designs, each with distinct characteristics and cultural significance. The art form can be systematically classified into multiple categories based on various differentiating factors.
Primary Classification Systems
1. Structural Classification Based on Design Elements
Pulli Kolam (Dot-Based Kolam)
Pulli kolam forms the foundation of most kolam designs, characterized by a systematic grid of dots (pulli) that serve as reference points. The dots are arranged equidistantly to create a base design grid, with patterns formed by connecting these dots using lines. This represents the simplest form of kolam, often used by beginners and serving as the structural backbone for more complex variations.

                                    2.    Kambi Kolam (Line-Based Geometric Patterns)
Kambi kolam features intricate patterns made entirely with lines, creating geometric designs without relying on dot grids. These designs emphasize linear precision and geometric symmetry, often incorporating straight lines, angles, and structured patterns. The term "kambi" refers to the wire-like appearance of the interconnected lines.

                                   Sikku/Chikku Kolam (Interlaced/Knotted Patterns)

Sikku kolam represents one of the most sophisticated forms, featuring curved lines that move gracefully around dots in continuous loops. The term "sikku" means "knots" in Tamil, reflecting the intricate interlacing nature of these designs. These kolams are characterized by their entangled lines that create rhythm through repeating graphs, making them visually captivating but challenging to memorize
These images demonstrate the characteristic features of Sikku Chikku kolam:
•	Continuous interlaced lines that weave around dots in complex loops
•	Knotted patterns where lines cross and interweave continuously
•	Snake-like curves that flow gracefully around the dot grid
•	Symmetrical designs with repeating motifs

                             Neli Kolam (Curved Snake-like Patterns)
Neli kolam involves patterns where strokes run in curved, snake-like movements around dots. The stroke is called "neli" from its resembling a snakey line with knot-like structures. This style emphasizes fluid, organic curves that flow naturally around the dot grid.
Neli Kolam Characteristics
The Neli kolam patterns are visible in several of these images, particularly showing:
•	Serpentine curved lines that resemble snake-like movements
•	Flowing organic curves around the dot matrix
•	Smooth transitions between pattern elements
•	Natural, fluid line quality that differentiates it from geometric kambi kolam

2. On the basis of Geometric Arrangement Classifications
Ner Pulli Kolam (Square-Packed Dots)
This variation features loops created with square-packed dots, providing a structured, orthogonal foundation for pattern development.

Woda Pulli Kolam (Hexagonally-Packed Dots)
Utilizing hexagonally arranged dots, this style creates more complex geometric relationships and allows for intricate pattern variations.

Padi Kolam/Manai Kolam (Parallel Line Patterns)
Padi kolam consists predominantly of parallel lines drawn in repetitive, symmetrical arrangements to form geometric shapes. The basic design typically starts with a square foundation, with patterns built around it through the addition of parallel rows creating step-like formations. These designs are renowned for their precision and are often enhanced with red soil (kaavi) for contrast.

3. On the basis of Thematic and Occasion-Based Classifications
Margazhi Kolam (Festival Season Elaborate Designs)
The Margazhi month (mid-December to mid-January) represents the pinnacle of kolam artistry in Tamil Nadu. These kolams are characterized by elaborate, large-scale designs that often extend from courtyards to streets. Margazhi kolams frequently incorporate complex floral motifs, intricate geometric patterns, and vibrant colors, reflecting the celebratory nature of the season.

Daily Kolam (Simple Routine Patterns)
These are simpler designs created for everyday practice, typically smaller in scale and less complex than festival kolams. Daily kolams serve the practical purpose of welcoming prosperity while being manageable for regular creation

Wedding Kolam (Community Collaborative Designs)
Wedding kolams are elaborate, large-scale patterns that often involve 7-8 women working collaboratively. These designs stretch down streets and represent community celebration and social bonding

4. Regional and Family-Based Classifications
Spatial Classification
Patterns vary based on their location within the house - entrance kolams differ from those drawn in courtyards or prayer rooms.
Family Heritage Patterns
Each family maintains unique motifs passed down through generations, creating distinct familial kolam traditions.
Regional Style Variations
The Chettinad style portrays family homes and members in neat rows, while other regions emphasize everyday objects like spices and jewelry. Regional variations reflect local cultural preferences and available materials.
