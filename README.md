---

🌸 <b>Kolams</b>, also called <b>Rangolis</b>, are traditional Indian designs made with dots and patterns. They carry cultural, artistic, and even mathematical value. But today, these designs are slowly disappearing because they are not documented or preserved properly.

## 🤖 What is Kolam AI? <img width="189" height="223" align="right" alt="Kolam AI Example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f68d2f2-b1fb-4d01-b032-9457e815e3f3" />

Kolam AI is a digital platform that uses <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> and <b>Augmented Reality (AR)</b> to recognize, create, and preserve Kolam (Rangoli) designs. Users can upload a Kolam photo, and the system will detect its dot grid, symmetry, and style.

It can also generate new Kolam patterns, teach step-by-step drawing, and let people share designs in a community hub. A leaderboard and fun features keep users engaged, while AR lets them place Kolams in the real world. This way, tradition is preserved and enjoyed in a modern, interactive way.
